Option a: The first option is probably faster. That is because asking for requests from the server will take more time than 
reading it from the SP.

Option b: Reading the token each time from the server makes sure the current token is up-to-date, and incase someone tried
to cause problems it is probably more difficult to deal with the server than with the program itself.
